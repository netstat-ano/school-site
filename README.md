# [School site]

## TS + REACT + Firebase

This is my first typescript project. It's a school site on which you can create editors and admins in the admin dashboard. Editors are sending posts for acceptation to admins. Admins can accept posts or reject posts. Posts are shown in the navbar sorted by category (when you are creating a post you are setting the post's category). It's also possible to show posts on homepage. You can also add images to your posts.
